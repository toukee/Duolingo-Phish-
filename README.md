# Duolingo-Phish-

## Objective

To investigate a phishing email that successfully bypassed security filtering controls and reached the user’s inbox. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze email headers, identify spoofing indicators, evaluate attachment and link safety, and document findings using a structured SOC‑style workflow.
It also highlights my growing experience in recognizing social engineering patterns and validating suspicious emails with security tools.


### Skills Learned

• 	Identifying phishing indicators in email content and sender metadata
• 	Reviewing email headers for anomalies (Return‑Path, SPF, DKIM, domain mismatch)
• 	Understanding how phishing emails bypass filtering controls
• 	Evaluating suspicious links and attachments safely
• 	Using online tools to validate domains, URLs, and file hashes
• 	Documenting findings clearly using a SOC‑style investigation format
• 	Strengthening ability to distinguish legitimate vs. spoofed communication
• 	Mapping activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (Phishing, Initial Access)
• 	Improving triage workflow: verify → analyze → conclude

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Defender XDR – alert context, email entity analysis, and message trace review
- Email Header Analysis Tools – reviewing SPF, DKIM, and sender metadata
- VirusTotal – URL and attachment reputation checks
- CyberChef – decoding, URL parsing, and safe inspection
- ANY.RUN – dynamic analysis of suspicious links or files
- Notepad++ – organizing notes and reviewing extracted data
- Browser DevTools – inspecting URLs and redirect behavior
- Windows Defender – validating local endpoint safety
